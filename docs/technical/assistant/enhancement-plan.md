# Unified Adaptive AI Assistant - Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to enhance our existing Unified Adaptive AI Assistant with interactive features based on the UX concept. The enhancements will transform the assistant from a suggestion provider to an interactive AI companion that helps users throughout their JobMate journey.

## 1. Database Schema Extensions

### AssistantMemoryLog Enhancements
- Add `helpful` boolean field to track if interactions were useful
- Add `feedbackText` optional string field for user comments
- Add `aiGenerated` boolean to distinguish between rule-based and AI-generated content

### AssistantChat Model
- Create new model to store chat history between users and the assistant
- Include fields for messages, timestamps, context, and mode

```prisma
model AssistantChat {
  id          String      @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  messages    Json        // Array of {role, content, timestamp}
  mode        String      // Current assistant mode
  context     String      // Page context
  createdAt   DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime    @updatedAt
  
  user        User        @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

### AssistantPrompt Model
- Store predefined prompts for different contexts and modes

```prisma
model AssistantPrompt {
  id          String      @id @default(cuid())
  title       String      // Display text for the prompt button
  content     String      // Actual prompt content for AI
  mode        String      // Which assistant mode this belongs to
  context     String      // More specific context within the mode
  priority    Int         // Display order priority
  isActive    Boolean     @default(true)
  createdAt   DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime    @updatedAt
}
```

## 2. API Routes Implementation

### Memory Logs API
- Implement `/api/assistant/memory` route (GET, POST)
- Add feedback endpoints for tracking helpful/unhelpful interactions

### Chat API
- Create `/api/assistant/chat` route for message history and new messages
- Implement streaming responses for AI-generated content

### Prompts API
- Add `/api/assistant/prompts` route to fetch context-specific prompt buttons
- Include admin endpoints for managing available prompts

### AI Integration
- Set up OpenAI/GPT-4 integration with proper error handling and rate limiting
- Create middleware for authentication and usage tracking

## 3. Frontend Components

### Interactive Chat Interface
- Add chat input field and message history to AIAdaptivePanel
- Implement typing indicators and message streaming
- Add copy/insert buttons for generated content

### Prompt Suggestion Buttons
- Create PromptSuggestions component with context-aware buttons
- Implement onClick handlers to trigger AI responses or actions

### Form Field Auto-Insert
- Create utility functions to insert AI-generated content into form fields
- Add DOM manipulation helpers with proper React integration

### Visual Enhancements
- Add idle animations for the assistant button when suggestions are available
- Implement smooth transitions between states
- Add notification badges for new suggestions

### Mobile Adaptations
- Create responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Implement bottom navbar integration for mobile devices
- Add swipe gestures for dismissing the assistant panel

## 4. AI Assistant Service

### OpenAI Integration
- Set up API client and environment variables
- Implement prompt engineering for different contexts
- Add error handling and fallbacks

### Context-Aware Responses
- Pass relevant user data and page context to AI prompts
- Implement history tracking for conversational context

### Learning System
- Track which suggestions and responses users find helpful
- Use feedback to improve future suggestions

## 5. Enhanced Suggestion Engine

### Advanced Rules
- Expand rule-based suggestions with more sophisticated patterns
- Integrate with more JobMate services for better context awareness

### Hybrid Approach
- Combine rule-based suggestions with AI-generated content
- Implement caching for common AI responses to reduce API costs

### Personalization
- Use user history and preferences for more tailored suggestions
- Implement A/B testing for different suggestion types

## 6. Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Database schema extensions
- Basic API routes
- Chat interface UI components

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)
- AI service integration
- Prompt suggestions
- Form auto-insert functionality

### Phase 3: Polish & Optimization (Week 3)
- Visual enhancements
- Mobile adaptations
- Performance optimizations

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Week 4)
- User testing and feedback
- Bug fixes and refinements
- Production deployment

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Implement lazy loading for assistant components
- Use efficient state management to prevent re-renders
- Cache AI responses when appropriate

### Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting for AI requests
- Ensure proper authentication for all API routes

### Accessibility
- Ensure all components meet WCAG standards
- Add keyboard navigation support
- Test with screen readers

## 8. Migration Strategy

- Generate non-interactive Prisma migration script
- Test migrations in staging environment
- Deploy with minimal downtime
- Include rollback plan for any issues

## Next Steps

1. Begin with database schema extensions
2. Implement memory logs API route
3. Create interactive chat interface components
4. Set up AI integration service
