# JobMate Affiliate & Referral Program

## Overview

The JobMate Affiliate & Referral Program creates powerful growth loops by incentivizing users to refer others to the platform and specific services. This document outlines the architecture, implementation details, and features of the program.

## ‚úÖ Core Referral System Architecture

### üîÅ 1. User-to-User Referrals (Global Growth Loop)

**Goal**: Grow platform user base organically through existing user networks.

**Mechanism**: Users refer other users to join the platform through unique referral links or codes.

**Rewards**:
- **Option A**: Store credit or cash back based on referred user's spend
- **Option B**: Discount codes (e.g., 15% off services, goods, bookings)

**Dashboard**: Shows total invites, converted users, total earnings or credits.

**Incentives**:
- Referral tiers (100+, 500+, etc.)
- Limited-time multiplier bonuses (holiday boosts, "3 in 24 hours" challenge)

**Abuse Protection**: 
- 1 device/email/IP per referral
- Spend threshold before payout
- AI-driven fraud detection

### üß∞ 2. User-to-Specialist Referrals (Service-Specific Loop)

**Goal**: Drive bookings for specific providers/gigs.

**Mechanism**: Users share links or codes tied to specific services/gigs/specialists.

**Rewards**: Earn a commission percentage of the booking value when the referred user completes a booking.

**Specialist Setup**:
- When posting a gig/service, a specialist sets an affiliate commission percentage
- Can opt-in/out per listing

**Tracking**:
- Link or QR code contains both the service ID and referrer ID
- Earnings tracked per service, per specialist

**Post-booking Logic**:
- Only paid/completed bookings trigger commission
- Optional satisfaction feedback before payout
