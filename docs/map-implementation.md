# Interactive Map Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the interactive map feature in the JobMate application. The map displays job locations with animated pulsing markers, filter options, and action buttons, providing users with an intuitive way to browse available jobs based on their preferences.

## Components Structure

The interactive map implementation consists of several modular components:

### 1. MapSearchBar

Located at: `/src/components/map/map-search-bar.tsx`

This component renders the search input field and filter button at the top of the map. It allows users to search for jobs or locations and access additional filtering options.

Features:
- Search input with placeholder text
- Filter button for advanced filtering
- Glassmorphic styling with backdrop blur

### 2. MapFilterChips

Located at: `/src/components/map/map-filter-chips.tsx`

This component displays a row of filter chips below the search bar, allowing users to quickly filter jobs by common categories.

Filter options:
- Hot (urgent jobs) - Red
- Verified - Green
- Neighbors - Blue
- Categories - Purple

Each chip toggles its respective filter and changes color when active.

### 3. MapActionButtons

Located at: `/src/components/map/map-action-buttons.tsx`

This component renders a vertical stack of action buttons on the right side of the map, providing quick access to job sorting and filtering options.

Button options:
- Accepted jobs (CheckCircle2 icon)
- Suggested jobs (ThumbsUp icon)
- Highest paying jobs (DollarSign icon)
- Newest jobs (Clock icon)

Each button toggles its respective filter and changes color when active.

### 4. InteractiveMapWithFilters

Located at: `/src/components/map/interactive-map-with-filters.tsx`

This is the main component that integrates all the UI elements with the Google Maps implementation. It displays job markers with pulsing animations and handles user interactions.

Features:
- Google Maps integration
- Animated pulsing markers with color-coding based on job status and urgency
- Integration of search bar, filter chips, and action buttons
- Mock job data with 16 diverse job listings
- Job selection handling

## Integration

The interactive map has been integrated into the unified dashboard page (`/src/components/pages/unified-dashboard-page.tsx`), replacing the previous map implementation. The map is displayed in a glassmorphic card below the Quick Overview section.

## Color Coding

Job markers are color-coded based on their status and urgency:

- Completed jobs: Green (#4ade80)
- In-progress jobs: Blue (#3b82f6)
- Accepted jobs: Light blue (#60a5fa)
- New jobs:
  - High urgency: Red (#ef4444)
  - Medium urgency: Orange (#f97316)
  - Low urgency: Teal (#10b981)
- Default: Purple (#9333ea)

## Animation

Job markers feature a pulsing animation effect to draw attention to available jobs. The animation consists of:

1. A solid circle representing the job location
2. A pulsing ring that expands and fades out

The animation is implemented using CSS animations defined in the `map-animations.module.css` file.

## Mobile Responsiveness

The map implementation is designed to be responsive, adapting to both desktop and mobile layouts. On mobile devices, the layout matches the provided screenshot with:

- Search bar at the top
- Filter chips below the search
- Action buttons stacked vertically on the right side

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the map feature:

1. Real-time job updates
2. Distance-based filtering
3. Category-specific marker icons
4. Clustering for areas with many jobs
5. Route planning and navigation integration
6. Job detail panel when a marker is selected
