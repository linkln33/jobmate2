# Hooks Directory

This directory contains custom React hooks used throughout the JobMate application.

## What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

## Directory Structure

This directory contains various custom hooks organized by functionality.

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Convention**: All hook files should be named with the prefix `use` (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each hook should focus on a specific piece of functionality
3. **Documentation**: Include JSDoc comments explaining the hook's purpose, parameters, and return values
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling within hooks
5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for critical hooks

## Example Hook Documentation

```typescript
/**
 * Hook for managing user authentication state
 * @param options Configuration options for the auth hook
 * @returns Authentication state and methods
 * 
 * @example
 * const { user, login, logout } = useAuth();
 * 
 * // Check if user is logged in
 * if (user) {
 *   // User is authenticated
 * }
 * 
 * // Login user
 * await login(email, password);
 * 
 * // Logout user
 * logout();
 */
export function useAuth(options?: AuthOptions) {
  // Implementation
}
```
