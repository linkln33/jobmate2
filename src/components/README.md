## Best Practices

1. **Component Organization**: Keep components in their appropriate directories based on functionality
2. **Component Documentation**: Each component should have JSDoc comments explaining its purpose and props
3. **Reusability**: Create reusable components when possible to maintain consistency
4. **Testing**: Write tests for critical components in the `__tests__` directory
5. **Naming Convention**: Use PascalCase for component names and kebab-case for file names

## Usage Guidelines

When creating new components:
1. Place them in the appropriate directory based on functionality
2. Include proper JSDoc documentation
3. Consider creating a dedicated README.md for complex component groups
